ALAC adopted **Aeris** to help **YOU**, our org members, with **your concerns and questions**. She will post **announcements on the group page** and **handle the ALAC twitter account**.

She is a **scarlet macaw** adopted from a reservation in **South America** where she was taken care of after her original habitat was destroyed. She has bright colorful feathers similar to the iridescent ALAC colors of <span style="color:red;">red</span>, <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>, <span style="color:green;">green</span>, and <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span>. We chose to have a parrot because as smart birds, parrots are capable of mimicking sounds that people make. After all, ALAC seeks to experience languages right?

Parrots are an **intelligent species of aves**, capable of **mimicking sounds and learning phrases** used in human communication. This is similar to how ALAC members learn a new language in **Turuan**.

Parrots are also very colorful birds, their feathers can range from <span style="color:red;">red</span>, <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>, <span style="color:green;">green</span>, <span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span> and <span style="color:gray;">white</span>. The scarlet macaw, in particular, has red, blue, and yellow on it - just like the ALAC logo! The **logo's colorful triangles** promote our core values of **diversity and inclusivity**. Since ALAC is not a home organization, we welcome members from the different courses in the Ateneo.

So come join Aeris and ALAC in **bridging cultures, experiencing languages**, and **celebrating the arts**!
