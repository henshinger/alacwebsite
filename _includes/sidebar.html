		<h3>About ALAC</h3>
		<p>
			The Ateneo Lingua Ars Cultura seeks to bridge, experience, and celebrate the diversity of the world through festive and experiential activities that broaden the knowledge of languages, deepen the appreciation of arts, and extend the borders of local and foreign culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            True to the meaning of Cultura, we aim to cultivate a community of adventurers who never cease to explore and seek to understand the colorful differences in culture, while immersing themselves in the similarities that truly unite us as one world. In the process of recognizing cultural diversity, we uncover new insights grounded on the awareness of our own Filipino heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to discover the world, join us as we bridge cultures, experience languages, and celebrate the arts! Be part of our very own ALACada today!
